# Historical URLs retained for legacy export links only. Scraping discovers
# each release's actual page IDs from its own TOC.
# Each entry is a 3-tuple: (page_id, url-slug, expected_h1_title)
# The expected_h1_title is used to detect Fortinet's redirect-to-default behaviour:
# when a section doesn't exist for a given version the URL resolves to a generic
# "Introduction and Supported Models" page instead.  Before scraping we confirm
# the actual page <h1> contains the expected title (case-insensitive substring
# match).  If it doesn't match we return [] for that version/section combination.
